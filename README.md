# RaptorQ-Codec
It is a RaptorQ codec on matlab. It is modified based on the work of Derrick Wrong.

The perfect assumption made by Derrick Wrong that repair symbols are error-free is modified because it is not practical.
So it is modified that repair symbols can be lost.

But this codec on matlab still runs very slow...
